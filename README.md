A JavaScript component for [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki)(hierarchical deterministic keys). **API is very unstable at the moment. Don't even think about using this.** Should stabilize within the next few days.

Thanks to the active BitcoinJS team and their hard work - some code borrowed from it.
